# basic-movie-theater-program
This program developed in Codeblocks IDE was created to model the purchasing and selling of tickets for a seat in a movie theater. The user must enter the value for tickets in each row, and then is brought to a menu where they may enter input to interact with the theater in various ways such as selling seats, viewing the prices and totals of the seats purchased, as well as seeing a visual representation of seats purchased in the theater. Menu options are input by typing the number of the option.
